# 🌍 **Who We Are**

**Desert Stream Partners International (DESPI)** is an indigenous African missions agency called and commissioned to glorify God among the unreached and the least-reached peoples of Africa, especially within the Muslim world.

We are a **faith-based ministry**, wholly anchored on biblical truth and dependent on God for direction, provision, and sustainability.

Our calling is to bring the life-giving message of Christ into the spiritual “deserts” of the world — transforming hearts, communities, and nations through the power of the gospel.

We began our journey from Nigeria to Sudan, and continue to extend the light of Christ to the ends of the earth.

# 💛 **Core Values**

### **1. God-Centered Living**

We seek to reflect Christ through discipleship and holy living. Just as believers in Antioch were called “Christians” because of their character, we desire our lives to testify of Jesus.

### **2. Passion for God and Compassion for People**

Jesus was moved with compassion. We follow His example to meet both the physical and spiritual needs of the unreached.

### **3. Church Planting & Spiritual Growth**

We partner with local churches to strengthen leadership, build believers, and promote dynamic, Spirit-led church growth across Africa.

### **4. Healthy Relationships**

We honor every individual’s background and cultivate mutual respect, encouragement, and acceptance in all ministry contexts.

### **5. Servant Leadership**

We train and develop leaders through biblically-based capacity building, emphasizing people over programs.

### **6. Innovative Mission Strategies**

As the world evolves through technology and global changes, we adapt mission strategies to remain relevant, effective, and impactful — without compromising biblical truth.

# 📜 **Statement of Faith**

### **God**

We believe in one eternal God, existing in three persons — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

### **Jesus Christ**

We believe in the deity of Jesus Christ: His virgin birth, sinless life, miracles, atoning death, bodily resurrection, ascension, intercession, and future return in glory.

### **The Holy Spirit**

We believe in the indwelling work of the Holy Spirit, empowering believers for holy living, service, and victorious witness.

### **The Bible**

We affirm the Holy Scriptures as the fully inspired, infallible, and authoritative Word of God.

### **Salvation**

We believe salvation comes by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone.

### **Humanity**

We believe all people are created in God’s image but fallen in sin, and in need of redemption through Christ.

### **The Church**

We believe in the unity of all true believers who form the Body of Christ, set apart to maintain doctrinal purity and spiritual integrity.

### **Resurrection**

We believe in the resurrection of both the saved (to eternal life) and the lost (to eternal separation from God).

### **The Great Commission**

We believe the Church is commanded to make disciples of all nations.
It is time for Africa to arise — using its God-given resources, wisdom, and sacrifice to take the gospel to every corner of the continent and beyond.
